Time: You should feel free to spend as much time on this assignment as necessary to feel comfortable with your answers. In general, candidates typically spend somewhere between 1 - 2 hours.

Background on the Data: 
Slack has a system that allows apps to send alerts to Slack users in 3 channels (banner, push, sidebar). 

We log two separate events into a table called alerts:
1. Whenever a user sees an alert (impression or 'imp')
2. Whenever a user clicks on an alert ('clk')

The table contains data for a single day. This logging is new and hasn't been vetted yet. Trust nothing, callout bad data, and work to clean the data as necessary to get the best answer.

Columns in the table:
user_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each user
team_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each team. Each userid belongs to exactly one team.
app_id: numeric, unique and persistent id for each app
event: string with values 'imp' (as in impression, so it was seen) or 'clk' (the user interacted with it)
primary_browser: string, the browser the user was using
alert_type: string, alert was in a banner/sidebar/push
eventtime: the timestamp of when the interaction happened

Questions:
#1 What is the best performing alert type?
#2 What apps are the best and worst performing?
#3 Iâ€™m curious about what the first alert a team clicked on in this day? For each alert_type, compute how many teams clicked an alert of that type as their first alert in a day.

Process
You should document your final solution in the left hand pane including any relevant thought process and exploration as well as your final answer to the questions. You may also interact with the data in the right hand pane as you work (but this won't be saved!). We'll be looking at the final product in the left hand pane but may also replay your entire session to see how you worked through the questions.
