Make sure any shared fields have alias reference!

lag / lead window functions always have a row with a null value, need to account for this! 

Ranking:
	how is the rank being done? asc or desc? 
	how do we treat repeated values? 

Where cluase for top 3 is less than or equal to 
	Where rank <= 3 	


for bottom N questionns, just reverse the order by to desc 


Ask questions, 
	the Employee Salaries (ETL Error) on Interviewquery is a good example of needing to clarify what 'Assume the INSERT operation works with ID autoincrement.' menas? 


when looking at overlaps
	if there is a start_date and end_date 
	need to compare both the start_date and end_date to the other start_date's and end_date's 
        and (s1.start_date between s2.start_date and s2.end_date 
        OR s1.end_date between s2.start_date and s2.end_date)

select 
    CASE WHEN s2.user_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END overlap,
    s1.user_id
    from subscriptions s1 
    left join subscriptions s2 
        on s1.user_id != s2.user_id
        and (s1.start_date between s2.start_date and s2.end_date 
            OR s1.end_date between s2.start_date and s2.end_date)


NULLS 
think abbout nulls when making comparisons 
Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.
Select 
    name 
    from Customer 
    Where referee_id != 2 
        or referee_id IS NULL                     


think about nulls in the case when comparsion 
need to filter them out in the having or the next where clause
