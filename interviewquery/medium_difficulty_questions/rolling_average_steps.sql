/* 
As a data analyst in a fitness app company, you are tasked with analyzing the userâ€™s daily step count.
Write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day rolling average of steps for each user, rounded to the nearest whole number.
Notes: The rolling average should only be calculated for days where there are 3 previous days of step counts, including the current day. 
The first 2 days for any user should be excluded.
