/* 
Letâ€™s say we want to improve the matching algorithm for drivers and riders for Uber. 
The engineering team has added a new column to the drivers table called weighting. 
It contains a weighted value, which they hope will lead to better matching.
Given this table of drivers, write a query to perform a weighted random selection of a driver based on the driver weight.
