#SQL hashtag#JOINs Cheatsheet

hashtag#INNER JOIN
- Returns only matching rows from both tables
- Most common type of join
- Excludes non-matching records
- Best for: Finding records that exist in both tables

hashtag#LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
- Returns all records from left table and matching records from right table
- NULL values for non-matching right table records
- Best for: Keeping all records from main table while getting optional related data

hashtag#RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
- Returns all records from right table and matching records from left table
- NULL values for non-matching left table records
- Best for: Same as LEFT JOIN but prioritizing right table

hashtag#FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
- Returns all records from both tables
- NULL values for non-matching records on either side
- Best for: Getting all data from both tables regardless of matches

hashtag#CROSS JOIN
- Returns Cartesian product of both tables
- Every row from first table paired with every row from second table
- No ON clause needed
- Best for: Generating all possible combinations

hashtag#Common JOIN Patterns

hashtag#Multiple JOINs hashtag#Self JOIN hashtag#JOIN with Additional Conditions

hashtag#Best Practices
1. Always use table aliases for better readability
2. Specify the join type explicitly (avoid implicit joins)
3. Use meaningful join conditions
4. Consider index usage for join columns
5. Start with the largest table in the FROM clause
6. Use WHERE clauses after joins for filtering

hashtag#Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to specify JOIN type (defaults to INNER)
2. Missing join conditions leading to cartesian products
3. Not handling NULL values properly
4. Joining on wrong columns
5. Using too many joins without proper indexing
